Overview
The Arduino Musical Keyboard with Pitch Control is a fun project that allows you to create music by playing different notes using your computer keyboard. You can also adjust the pitch of the notes to experiment with different musical scale.

The project is implemented using the Wokwi Arduino Simulator, which provides a virtual environment for testing and running Arduino code without the need for physical hardware. This makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced Arduino enthusiasts.

Prerequisites
Before getting started with this project, you will need the following:

Wokwi Account - Sign up for a free Wokwi account to access the online Arduino simulator.
Basic knowledge of Arduino programming (C++).

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in the Wokwi Arduino Simulator by visiting Wokwi, logging in to your account, and selecting "Create New Simulation."
Upload the files: “diagram.json”, “pitches.h” and “sketch.ino” to the simulator. You can either copy and paste the code or use the Arduino IDE integration within Wokwi to upload it.
Once the code is uploaded, you can interact with the virtual audio synthesizer using your computer's mouse.
Usage
Use the computer mouse to play notes: The musical keyboard allows you to play different notes. 
Adjust pitch:You can change the pitch by using the pitch control feature (potentiometer) in the code. 
Create music: Play different notes and melodies to compose your own music using the virtual keyboard.
